Kaggle Christmas Competition

Never really tried any kind of optimization. I simply wanted to get a valid solution that was better than the naive solution. 

I did this in C# in order to try out the Xamarin IDE on my mac. 

This was also an experiment in Test Driven Development. I started using TDD about halfway through. Had to refactor a bit to make everything testable, but I guess that's the whole point. I will continue applying TDD in the future.
